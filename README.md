I want to create a mobile app for users to play sports, specifically tennis, football, and pickleball. 

**User Login:**  
Users will need to log in via Facebook, Apple, or Google. 

**Onboarding:**  
New users will undergo onboarding, starting with choosing their preferred language (English, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, or French). They must select the sports they play and define their skill level for each sport. Users must also specify their location or areas of interest.

**Home Page:**  
After completing onboarding, users will be directed to the Home Page. The Home Page will have a footer navigation menu with rounded edges and padding at the bottom. The menu will include the following options: Home, Applications, Plus, Chat, and User.

**User Section:**  

- **User Profile:**
  - **Personal Information:** Display name, age, location, bio, sport and position details, city of play, list of clubs, and federations joined, achivements
  - **Activity Log:** Record of recent activities and events participated in.
  - **Edit Profile:** Option to update personal information and preferences.
- **Settings:**
  - **Account Settings:** Account linking and notification preferences.
  - **App Preferences:** Dark/light mode, language, and other preferences.
  - **Support:** Access help articles or contact customer support.

- **Logout:** Option to log out of the app.

**Plus Section:**  
Users can:
- Create a federation (paid service)

- Create a challenge
- Become a trainer in specific sports
- Add a place (e.g., badminton court, football pitch, tennis court)
